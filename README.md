# Treehouse Tutorials for Code Louisville

This is my second session of the beginner course of **Code Louisville**. This time around, I'm making sure I have the right tools and utilities under my belt to gain a better understanding of the machines and the internet.

I'm currently running Linux Ubuntu in VirtualBox to familiarize myself with working in a POSIX environment as opposed to Windows 10.

I quite prefer Windows 10 for a majority of my computing, but I'm learning Linux to be in a better position to attempt to establish understanding of the environment and ecosystem.

## Here's the Treehouse track I'm following for the [Front End Web Development](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/front-end-web-development-2) course designed for Code Louisville

- [x] [Console Foundations](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/console-foundations) 
    *3 hours*
    This course is rightly the first course in the track. In the first session (full-stack JavaScript) we were told to use the terminal and git to manage our projects. However, trying to keep up with the front-end dev courses while also being completely lost in terminal and git (as well as losing my the primary Mac OSX machine I was using as my learning environment 1-2 months into the course) sealed my failure. 
    But... having failed out of the first session helped me have a better understanding of *what* I need to be looking at to be prepared to manage my projects before I start making them.

## Final Project
I think what I want to do is begin creating a sort of **Creation Wizard UI** for querying data and building samples for data analysis
